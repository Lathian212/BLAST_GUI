To remove, call either frm.pack_forget() or frm.grid_forget() depending on whether the frame was packed or grided.

Then call frm.destroy() if you aren't going to use it again, or hold onto the reference and repack or regrid when you want to show it again.

pack_forget and grid_forget will only remove widgets from view, it doesn't destroy them.

Maybe, make all 5 BLASTS then then just toggle through them?

If you use pack_forget, you can later show the widget again calling pack again. If you want to permanently delete it, 
call destroy on the widget (then you won't be able to re-add it).

If you use the grid method, you can use grid_forget or grid_remove to hide the widget.
